# Real-Time-Sports-Data-Analysis

## Introduction

In a world where cricket is not just a sport but a celebrated global phenomenon, this project delves deep into the heart of T20 International cricket, uncovering the analytical trends and performance insights of players and teams.

This project revolves around the analysis and visualization of T20 cricket data, focusing on key metrics like runs, strike rates, wickets, and match outcomes. The primary goal is to provide comprehensive insights into team and player performance trends, enabling cricket enthusiasts and analysts to understand the dynamics of modern T20 cricket.

Using Power BI, I brought this data to life with interactive dashboards that make it easy to explore and draw conclusions. The project aims to give fans, analysts, and decision-makers a clearer view of the game, helping them appreciate the strategy behind every run scored and wicket taken.
